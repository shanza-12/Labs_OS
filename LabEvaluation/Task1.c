//Write a C program that creates 4 threads. Each thread should:
// 1.  Receive a unique number N as an argument (use values: 10, 20, 30, 40)
//2.  Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to N
//3.  Print the thread number and calculated sum
//4.  Return the sum through thread's return value
//Main thread should:
  //Create all 4 threads and pass arguments Wait for all threads to complete
 //Collect all return values
 //Calculate and print the total of all sums
